Machine Learning Checklist:
1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Explore the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms
5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

For Chapter 2 - Housing Corporation

Task - Use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the tate. 
    Metrics:
        Population
        Median Income
        Median Housing Price
    Per Block Group in CA 
        (Blocks / Districts - 600 - 3000 ppl)

1. Frame:
    What is the use case? 
    Model's Output = Prediction of a district's median housing prices
        Will be fed into another machine learning system and other signals
    What is the Current Situation? 
        Currently estimated manually by experts - estimating based on some math rules

What Kind of training supervision will the model need?
    Supervised
    Unsupervised
    Semi-Supervised
    Self-Supervised
    Reinforcement Learning Task

AND type
    Classification
    Regression
    other

OUR CASE:
    Supervised + Multiple Univariate Regression  (Mult Features, One Ouput)
    No Continuing data coming in

2. Performance Measure:
Root Mean Squared Error (From stats - Used for Regression)
RMSE =
    sqrt(1/m * sum(h(x)-y)^2)

Notation
    m - number of instances (size of training/validation set)
    x_i = vector of feature values for ith instance
    y_i = output of ith instance 

    X = input Matrix + Containg Feature values
        Each ROW is an Instance (x_1 is first row)
    h = prediction function (whatever method used to get prediction)
        y_hat_i = h(x_i)
    RMSE(X, h) = Cost function

Mean Absolute Error / Average Absolute Deviation
MAE = 
    1/m * sum(abs(h(x_i)- y_i))

RMSE -> || . ||  (Euclidean Norm) - Sensitive to Outliers
MAE -> | . | (Manhatten Norm)

3. Check Assumptions
    Downstream Conversion
    Make sure that you want Prices and not just Categories (regression vs Classification)
